                    <p>
                        New York City is famous for its tall buildings with
                        lights bright enough to see from outer space. Less well
                        known and equally less glamorous, New York City is also
                        a large consumer of nonrenewable fuel used to heat homes
                        for the millions residing in the city. The need for
                        cleaner air and cleaner use of energy is only becoming
                        more important with the current climate of the world. As
                        a result, the demand for programs that can provide clean
                        heating fuels for this city has consequently increased.
                        Programs have been put into action to deal with this
                        issue. The NYC Retrofit Accelerator has partnered with
                        the NYC Clean Heat Program with the aim to make
                        buildings more energy-efficient. By 2015, the program
                        has helped over 5,000 buildings convert to cleaner
                        energy, giving NYC the cleanest air its had in fifty
                        years. Greener Greater Buildings is the United State’s
                        most ambitious set of energy efficiency laws focused on
                        New York City’s largest buildings. GGB requires the
                        buildings to benchmark energy and water use with public
                        disclosure annually, hoping that the transparency will
                        result in more careful use of energy and water. In order
                        to better understand the programs, it is important to
                        note the fuels used and their pros and cons. No. 4 and
                        No. 6 fuels, also known as heavy or residual fuels, are,
                        although inexpensive and high energy, fuels that
                        contribute a lot to air pollution. The DEP Boiler
                        Registration, short for Department of Environmental
                        Protection Boiler Registration, is a program designed to
                        regulate the operation of boilers within a given
                        jurisdiction. All of these programs and increasing aware
                        of the problems are signs that New York is moving
                        towards a more environmentally sound future.

                    <h1>HC 4: NYC Emissions</h1>
                    <p>
                        Queens, located in the heart of New York City, is a
                        sprawling borough known for its immense cultural
                        diversity and vibrant communities. Queens boasts a
                        multifaceted urban environment, characterized by an
                        eclectic mix of building types, ranging from towering
                        residential structures to sprawling commercial
                        complexes. These architectural marvels, while
                        symbolizing the borough’s dynamism, also account for a
                        significant share of its carbon footprint. According to
                        data sourced from the New York City Mayor’s Office of
                        Sustainability, buildings in the city at large are
                        responsible for an astonishing 68% of greenhouse gas
                        emissions. Manhattan, the bustling core of the city,
                        records the highest emissions, with carbon dioxide (CO2)
                        emissions from buildings and transportation reaching 35
                        million metric tons in 2020, the highest among the
                        boroughs. Brooklyn, in contrast, has seen notable
                        reductions in emissions over the past decade, with a
                        significant decrease in CO2 emissions by approximately
                        15% from 2010 to 2020, thanks to energy-efficient
                        building upgrades and a growing preference for public
                        transportation. Queens grapples with emissions
                        challenges arising from suburban areas and industrial
                        zones, with CO2 emissions of 26 million metric tons in
                        2020, showing moderate progress through cleaner
                        technologies and sustainable urban planning. The Bronx,
                        once burdened with environmental disparities, has shown
                        commendable improvements in air quality and emissions
                        reductions, with CO2 levels decreasing by 12% from 2010
                        to 2020, primarily due to initiatives like tree planting
                        and stricter industrial regulations.
