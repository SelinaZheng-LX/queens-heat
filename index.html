                            New York City launched the NYC Clean Heat Program to
                            reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to
                            cleaner energy sources. The cityâ€™s focus on cleaner
                            heating fuels aligns with a broader global push
                            toward sustainability. Efforts like the DEP Boiler
                            Registration program and legislative acts
                            demonstrate a commitment to reducing emissions and
                            ensuring safer, more environmentally friendly
                            practices.

                            As Queens grapples with its substantial carbon
                            footprint of 58 megatons of CO2, it faces a crucial
                            pivot toward energy-efficient upgrades and renewable
                            energy adoption to mitigate its impact on the
                            environment.These initiatives signal a growing
                            momentum towards eco-conscious decisions, paving the
                            way for a more sustainable future in this diverse
                            and vibrant borough. The neighborhoods in Queens we
                            analyzed included Ridgewood, Astoria,
                            Douglaston-Little Neck, Briarwood, and Forest Hills

                            These predominantly residential neighborhoods
                            showcase ethnic diversity, boast a high average high
                            school graduation rate, and primarily feature an
                            income distribution under $50,000, representing a
                            mix of working-class and middle-class residents.
                            Within our research in Queens, we reached a
                            significant conclusion. Most energy usage is not
                            because of transportation, but because of elevator
                            apartments. The only type of building closest would
                            be walk-up apartments, however, these mostly use No.
                            4 fuels. Now, elevator apartments use a nearly equal
                            amount of No. 4 and No. 6 fuels, which is much
                            higher than other apartments. These fuels devastate
                            the environment because of harmful chemicals they
                            emit such as sulfur when burned. Alas, we are
                            dependent on these fuels to provide energy to our
                            buildings.

                            According to the NYC Clean Heat dataset, Ridgewood,
                            Astoria, and Douglaston-Little Neck lean towards No.
                            4 fuels due to a comparatively higher income level.
                            Briarwood, with its lower income status,
                            predominantly utilizes No. 6 fuels. Forest Hills
                            displays a balanced fuel ratio. These neighborhoods
                            reflect distinct social and economic landscapes,
                            influencing their choices in heating fuels and
                            environmental impact. Still, with incentives and
                            increased transparency with building owners and the
                            public under the NYC Clean Heat program, we will be
                            able to combat energy usage and ensure New York
                            stays green.
